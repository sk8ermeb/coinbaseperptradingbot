# coinbaseperptradingbot
A way to build a trading algorithm for coin base perpetual futures with backtesting

It's not ready, still developing. I will chenge this when its worth taking a look at.

# Requirements
Should run on any OS. Must have python3.13 in your path. python3.13 --version
I am just one guy so I don't want to spend the time to version test accross different
dependencies. But most are pretty generic and should work on older pythons. 
# Install
## Linux/MacOS
./setup.sh
## Windows
git bash setup.sh

# Use case
Open a browser and go 127.0.0.1:8080
There are some settings in config.txt if you want to have TLS or login

# No Warrantee
If you use this code you do so without any warrantee whatsoever. I am not liable for anything that goes wrong
I am just writing this for myself and if ofer tech people want to see what I have done it is on them. I am 
not checking for edge case bugs or following industry best practices for security.
