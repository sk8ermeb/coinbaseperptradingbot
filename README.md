# coinbaseperptradingbot
A way to build a trading algorithm for coin base perpetual futures with backtesting

It's not ready, still developing. I will chenge this when its worth taking a look at.

# Requirements
Should run on any OS. Must have python3.13 in your path. python3.13 --version
I am just one guy so I don't want to spend the time to version test accross different
dependencies. But most are pretty generic and should work on older pythons.
